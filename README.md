## ðŸ‘‹ Hi Dear Future Friend,

- Iâ€™m a PhD candidate  at [Kimia Lab](https://kimialab.uwaterloo.ca/kimia/), University of Waterloo that has a strong interest in **computer science and _software development_**.

- **_Deep learning_ and machine learning** projects are what I'm interested in working on. For the most part, my skills lie on computer vision areas such as **generative adversarial networks (_GAN_),Â _super-resolution_, segmentation and classification**. I would, however, be delighted to contribute to any NLP endeavour.
- ðŸ“« You may get in touch with me by sending me a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mafshari/) message.
