# ðŸ‘‹ Hi Stranger, Iâ€™m Mehdi

- Iâ€™m a PhD candidate  at **Kimia Lab**, University of Waterloo that has a strong interest in **computer science** and **software development**.

- Deep learning and machine learning projects are what I'm interested in working on. For the most part, my skills lie on computer vision areas such as generative adversarial networks (GAN),Â super-resolution, segmentation and classification. I would, however, be delighted to contribute to any NLP endeavour.
